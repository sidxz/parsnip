## Protein Assessment and Ranking System for Novel Input
Designed to support the early stages of anti-TB research, PARSNIP is an open-source tool that ranks potential drug targets using a multi-dimensional scoring system. It evaluates proteins based on their biological importance, safety profile, and "druggability," providing a clear, visual way to compare different targets. As a public companion to the internal DAIKON system, it empowers the global research community to make evidence-based decisions and refine target priorities in real-time, offering a template that can be used for various bacterial threats.
